## Background

We show that (1) the space of stationary models is bigger than expected, and includes hidden Markov models (HMM), (2) Phase & autoregressive randomizations test for stationarity, linearity, Gaussianity, (3) Resting-state fMRI is mostly stationary, linear, and Gaussian. (4) 1st order autoregressive (AR) model encodes static & one-lag functional connectivity, and (5) 1st order AR model explains sliding window correlations very well, better than HMM.

## Code Release

This folder contains the code used to generate the results presented in our paper.

CBIG_RL2017_Figure4_toy_ex_HMM.m           reproduces the results presented in Figure 4 of the referenced paper
CBIG_RL2017_Figure7_toy_ex_bi_vs_multi.m   reproduces the results presented in Figure 7 of the referenced paper

Other results of the paper were obtained by combining autoregressive and phase randomization procedures. These procedures are implemented in CBIG_RL2017_get_AR_surrogate.m and CBIG_RL2017_get_PR_surrogate.m. Different options are detailed in the headers of the corresponding codes.
